The Project at this stage seeks to implement the following features,
  1)Natural Languange Processing - Teachers can upload their chapter.txt files and then the web app will produce MCQs or Tests based on that
  2)Data Analysis - Students can enter marks they got in various tests, and teacher can check analysis results based on those scores
